Why Did we move from react-redux to Redux Toolkit 

Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux toolkit is simple, opinionated, powerful and effective.
React-redux  configuration setup is extremely complicated. Taking these issues into account and in an effort to abstract the setup process, the Redux Toolkit package was built. Additionally, Redux requires a lot of boilerplate code, which most developers donâ€™t like doing, where you find yourself writing action creators over and over again. Redux Toolkit package was built in mind to so solve these cases by abstracting the setup process and also handling redux common use cases.
